## Description

This project is a React.Js web application with a Python and SQLite backend used for grabbing and storing REDCap data.
This project was created as part of our residency from Immersive Software Engineering in the University of Limerick.  
Initially this was just a tool for conducting Aimhigh visits and appointment bookings but this has now been expanded to a multitude of studies as a way to replace the google calendar. (Implementation of this google calendar is not yet integrated.)
